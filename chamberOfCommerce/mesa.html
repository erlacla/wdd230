      <h2>Mesa: A rich heritage</h2>
      <img src="images/mesaMan.jpg" alt="Man in Mesa">
      <p>
        As a resident of Mesa, Az, I'm proud of our rich heritage. Mesa was founded in 1878 by Daniel Webster
        Jones, a pioneer member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The first settlement was 
        located in Lehi, in North Mesa. When Mesa was first registered as town it was only one square mile of land.
        Now Mesa is the third largest city in Arizona with a population of over 500,000 and close to 140 sq miles.
        Mesa residents enjoy sunshine all year round and gorgeous views of the superstition mountains.
        Mesa has a booming economy and is the ideal place for entrepreneurs!

        <h2>Updates on the Renovation</h2>
        <p>
          <img src="images/garage.jpg" alt="The Groves garage">If you drive down Mesa Drive the scenery may seem unfamiliar to you. Many hours and resources have
          been  to The Grove on Main Townhomes and Apartments. The Grove boasts gorgeous pool and spa,
          a 2 story fitness center, and a direct-access parking garage. The historic Mesa Temple also underwent
          several renovations making the downtown Mesa area breathtaking! Newly paved roads and sidewalks are
          the cherry on top! All of the renovations are boosting
           Mesa's leading economy even more and bringing
          in business to the shops in downtown Mesa that struggled with COVID-19 last year. Things are looking
          great! Come see the changes!<img src="images/recentNews400.jpg" alt="Mesa temple">

          <h2>Priceless: History preserved</h2>
          <p><img src="images/temple400.jpg" alt="Mesa Temple">
            The historic Mesa, AZ temple is almost 95 years old. Many necessary renovations were needed and 
            it was announced that the temple would close for a two year restoration with several major projects
            planned for  interior and exterior of the temple. 
            Before the temple grounds closed to the public,
            six skilled photographers came to capture the temple before all the changes happened. These photos 
            are priceless to members of the community who have special connections to the historic edifice, many
            of whom were married there and even have parents and grandparents who were also married there. These
            local citizens cherish the last photo's and look forward to when the temple will re-open.
